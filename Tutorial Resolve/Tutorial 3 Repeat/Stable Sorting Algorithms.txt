1) Insertion Sort:  When inserting a new element into the osrted portion of the array, 
                    we insert it just after the first element >= to it, or at the beginning 
                    of the array, if all elements are greater than it. So it is placed
                    after elements equal to it.
                    Hence: STABLE
2) Merge Sort:      In merging the two sorted halves of the array (which we shall assume to
                    be stably sorted), we ensure that equal elements are in their original 
                    order.
                    Hence: STABLE
3) Bubble Sort:     STABLE
4) Selection Sort:  NOT STABLE
                    When choose the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array, we 
                    swap it with the first unsorted element, which can displace its order with 
                    respect to other elements equal to it.
5) Quick Sort:      NOT STABLE
                    In the partitioning scheme, elements greater than pivot are moved in such a
                    way that it is possible to destroy the order of such an element with respect 
                    to other elements equal to it.
